# ðŸ“Š Insurance Company Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project showcases an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze the performance of an insurance company that eventually shut down due to unsustainable financial losses. 
The dashboard highlights **policies, premiums, claims, and customer segments** to uncover the underlying reasons for the collapse.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Project Objective

To create a **data-driven dashboard** that tracks key business metrics and provides insights into:

* Policies sold and premium collections
* Claims analysis and cost drivers
* Customer segmentation by demographics & vehicle types
* Year-over-year performance trends

---

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Highlights

* **KPIs:**

  * 508K policies sold
  * \$4B total premiums
  * \$9B total claims
  * **44% premium-to-claim ratio**

* **Segmentation:**

  * Policyholders by **vehicle type**
  * Gender-wise claims
  * Usage categories

* **Trend Analysis:**

  * Year-over-year **claims vs. premiums**
  * **Heatmap** of usage categories
  * Demographic claim patterns

* **Tools Used:**

  * **Power Query** â€“ data preparation
  * **DAX** â€“ calculated measures
  * **Power BI visuals** â€“ KPIs, slicers, drill-throughs, interactive charts

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

* **High-risk categories:** Motorcycles (106K), Trucks (94K), and Pickups (90K) were the largest policyholder groups but also drove **excessive claim costs**.
* **Unsustainable model:** Total claims (\$9B) far exceeded premiums (\$4B), resulting in **heavy financial losses**.
* **Category trends:** Agricultural vehicles, Car Hires, and Fare-paying passenger categories showed **disproportionately high claim growth**.
* **Demographic insights:** One gender group accounted for **63% of claims**, suggesting deeper demographic risk factors.
